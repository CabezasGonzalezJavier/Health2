# About
  This project:
        - MVC.
        -  Mokito.
        -  GSON.
        -  ORM.
        -  ViewHolder.
  
  I chose MVP(Model, View, Controller).
  JUnit and Mokito, It lets you write beautiful tests with clean & simple API.  The tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors.
  
  Data base I chose a ORM library:
  
  https://github.com/kvirair/SQLite-Simple-Android
  
  I have experience with this library because it's very quickly.
  
  LisView Adapter I chose a ViewHolder implementation allows to avoid the findViewById() method in an adapter.A ViewHolder class is typically a static inner class in your adapter which holds references to the relevant views. in your layout. This reference is assigned to the row view as a tag via the setTag() method.
